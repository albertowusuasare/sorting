EXERCISE 1: Code Reading

a)

According to the documentation online 
Arrays.copyOfRange is used to copy the specified range of values of 
some original array into a new array

I think we do this because in each recursive call to sort we want to 
parse in an array that contains have the range of values of the original

b) The program seems short for two reasons:

1. we have seperated the implementation of merging two sorted arrays together
from our current implementation. This seperation is the Utils.merge method

2. we are using the magic of recursion and so the perhaps longer form of 
what we have would be to write code for every step of the entire process.
Because recursion is simply do something similar again and again, we are able
to write much shorter code.
